# Data Visualization in Oasis

This documentation outlines various visualization techniques and procedures available in the Oasis platform. These visualizations help analyze and interpret simulation results effectively.

## Reddit Score Analysis

The Reddit Score Analysis visualization allows you to compare scores between different treatment groups in your simulations.

### Prerequisites

- Completed simulation using `scripts/reddit_simulation_align_with_human/reddit_simulation_align_with_human.py`
- Generated database file and JSON file from the simulation

### Steps to Generate Visualization

1. **Set up file paths**

   After running your simulation, modify the file paths in `visualization/reddit_simulation_align_with_human/code/analysis_all.py`:

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       folder_path = ("visualization/reddit_simulation_align_with_human"
                      "/experiment_results")
       exp_name = "business_3600"  # Use your experiment name
       db_path = folder_path + f"/{exp_name}.db"
       exp_info_file_path = folder_path + f"/{exp_name}.json"
       analysis_score.main(exp_info_file_path, db_path, exp_name, folder_path)
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the analysis script**

   ```bash
   python visualization/reddit_simulation_align_with_human/code/analysis_all.py
   ```

4. **Examine Results**

   The script will generate a visualization showing scores for three treatment groups (down-treated, control, up-treated) at the experiment's conclusion.

## Reddit Counterfactual Content Analysis

This visualization helps analyze differences in content across various treatment conditions.

### Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key added to environment variables
- Completed simulation using `scripts/reddit_simulation_counterfactual/reddit_simulation_counterfactual.py`
- Generated database files from the simulation

### Steps to Generate Visualization

1. **Configure database paths**

   After running your simulation, update the database file paths in `visualization/reddit_simulation_counterfactual/code/analysis_couterfact.py`:

   ```python
   db_files = [
       'couterfact_up_100.db',
       'couterfact_cnotrol_100.db',
       'couterfact_down_100.db'
   ]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv add aiohttp

   # Or using pip
   pip install aiohttp
   ```

3. **Run the analysis script**

   ```bash
   python visualization/reddit_simulation_counterfactual/code/analysis_couterfact.py
   ```

4. **Examine Results**

   The script will generate a visualization showing disagree scores for three treatment groups (down-treated, control, up-treated) at each timestep of the experiment.

## Dynamic Follow Network Visualization

This visualization provides an interactive way to explore user follow relationships over time using Neo4j.

### Prerequisites

- Neo4j account and a free instance
- Neo4j credentials (`NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USERNAME`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD`) saved as environment variables
- Completed simulation generating a database file

### Steps to Create Visualization

1. **Set up Neo4j**

   - Register at [https://neo4j.com/](https://neo4j.com/)
   - Create a free instance
   - Obtain and save credentials as environment variables
   - Connect to the instance

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install neo4j
   ```

3. **Configure database path**

   Modify the database path in either:

   - `visualization/dynamic_follow_network/code/vis_neo4j_reddit.py` (for Reddit data)
   - `visualization/dynamic_follow_network/code/vis_neo4j_twitter.py` (for Twitter data)

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       sqlite_db_path = "all_360_follow.db"  # Replace with your SQLite database path
       main(sqlite_db_path)
   ```

4. **Run the appropriate script**

   ```bash
   python visualization/dynamic_follow_network/code/vis_neo4j_reddit.py
   # or
   python visualization/dynamic_follow_network/code/vis_neo4j_twitter.py
   ```

5. **Explore the visualization**

   - Visit [https://console.neo4j.io/](https://console.neo4j.io/) dashboard
   - Use the explore page
   - In the search bar, select `user-follow-user`
   - For the slicer, choose `follow-timestamp` to visualize changes in follow relationships over time

## Additional Visualization Options

Beyond the core visualization techniques described above, the Oasis platform supports customized visualizations based on specific simulation needs. Developers can extend existing visualization modules or create new ones for specialized analysis requirements.
